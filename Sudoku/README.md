# Sudoku project
This mini project was a task from Softuni, that I did the logic for both 3x3 and 9x9 tiles. I decided to add it, because it seems appropriate to be here.
### It's a game of Sudoku, where you have to complete either the 3x3 field or the 9x9 in the browser with user interface.
With this project I have shown my ability to work with **DOM manipulations, working with arrays, sets, cycles** and **knowledge in the HTML field**.
