# Connect Four project
This is my fourth project that I did in the beginning of August 2023. It started as the final lecture of the course **Python Advanced**, but I decided to do in on my own and expand it.
### It's a console version of the game **Connect Four**. You can play it with another player or with Chat Gpt.
With this project I have shown that I **structure my code well, can work with various python libraries, know: functional programming, working with cycles, lists and matrices**, and most importantly - **working with Chat Gpt's API**.
