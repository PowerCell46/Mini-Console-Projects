# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
This is my first project that I did in the beginning of 2023, just after finishing **Programming Basics with Python and learning JS and Python Fundamentals**.
### It's a game of Tic-Tac-Toe that you can play in the console either with another player or either with Chat GPT.
Looking back at it in the summer I decided thought that the code was badly written and decided to optimize it. 
In this project I have shown my knowledge with **functional programming, working with cycles, lists and matrices, error handling, using various python libraries** and most importantly **working with Chat GPT's API**.
